# Playnite MultiMC Library Extension

Adds support for importing [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) instances to [Playnite](https://playnite.link/).

## Installation

TODO

You have to restart Playnite after installing the extension.

## Usage

In your Playnite add-on settings, go to Extension settings > Libraries > MultiMC, and set the path to your MultiMC installation folder.

Playnite will update your library automatically upon launch, but you can go to Update Game Library > MultiMC to do so manually.
